TODO:

Menu
	Text for Transform + R-button examine
	Usability
	Effect
		Add a new parameter to the action struct jump table
		Actually do the transformation

Save
	Save old stats in spare space in debuff table? (enemies start at 203F500)
	Save transformation gauge (byte 0x47, if it's saved on suspend; otherwise, I can use something else)
	0x47 is not saved, but 0x46 is
	0x46 is written to at 3C240
	
Edit growths routine to level up Xane's original stats when transformed
Stat boosters should increase transformed and untransformed stats
Detransform (normal and when chapter ends)
Figure out where to display transformation timer on stat screen (maybe next to the portrait, like MoD's current fatigue counter?)

#############

Unit menu option added in _MasterHackInstaller.event
/Text/textbuildfile.txt is the actual text buildfile, #included my text in that
UnitActionRework.event in Stan's folder updated; Transform uses action byte 0x23
Added #include for the folder in Master Skill Installer.event
Display inserted where the Exp number is written
Edited con getter so Xane's transformation will use the copied unit's base char con
Edited canto+ check to make sure Xane cannot canto after transforming

For Stone effect
call 2CE0 with r1=parent, r0=stone_proc... or call 7E1E4 with r0 = xane data ptr?
