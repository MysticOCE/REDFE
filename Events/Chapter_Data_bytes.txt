FE8 chapter data table (8B0890)
0xoffset - byte amount - what it is
00 - 4 - pointer to something (seems to be a series of tile ids that get copied to BG 0, but idk) (1C06E, 1C820)
04 - 1 - object type
05 - 1 - object type 2 (seems to be 0 usually, so it ends up being not used)
06 - 1 - palette id
07 - 1 - tile config id
08 - 1 - map id
09 - 1 - tile animation 1
0A - 1 - tile animation 2
0B - 1 - triggerable map changes id
0C - 1 - fog of war vision range (0 for none) (BAC4)
0D - 1 - battle preparations bool
0E - 1 - chapter ID (I think) (89792)
0F - 1 - 
10 - 1 - initial camera x coordinate? (20BCA) (function is run at when starting the chapter, but changing the values doesn't seem to do anything)
11 - 1 - initial camera y coordinate? (20BEA)
12 - 1 - weather 
13 - 1 - battle tileset id (574EE)
14 - 1 - bottom 4 bits are easy mode level penalty, top 4 bits are hard mode bonus levels (F830)

16 - 2 - Player phase music
18 - 2 - Enemy phase music
1A - 2 - NPC phase music
1C - 2 - Probably supposed to be hard mode music like in FE7, but isn't
1E - 2 - ^
20 - 2 - ^
22 - 2 - Player (and NPC) phase music if event 0x4 is set (almost certainly a mistake; if 0x26 is the NPC phase music #3, change 16000 to 0x8)
24 - 2 - Enemy phase music if event 0x4 is set
26 - 2 - Probably should be NPC phase music if event 0x4 is set, but isn't
28 - 2 - Chapter opening music/sfx
2A - 2 - ^ ? (probably Eliwood vs Hector mode leftover)
2C - 1 - maximum wall hp

2D-6F probably relates to what used to be rankings data.
70 - 2 - chapter name text id (doesn't seem to be used?) (346E0 doesn't dereference the text id... not sure what to make of this) (B66C4 and some others do, however)
72 - 2 - ^ ? (probably Eliwood vs Hector mode leftover)
74 - 1 - chapter event index
75 - 1 - world map event index
76 - 2 - unused (A09A8) (Probably leftover augury stuff from FE7)
7A - 2 - bool, checked if not hard mode at A098C. Doesn't seem to be used. (954C0)

7E - 1 - unused (A09FC)
7F - 1 - unused (A09E0)

81 - 1 - 
82 - 1 - x coordinate if supply depot (probably leftover from fe7 merlinus) (123C2, 124B0)
83 - 1 -
