[OpenMidLeft]
Hello again. I've told my soldiers[NL]
to stand down for the time being.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That's very much appreciated.[NL]
So, you've had a change of heart?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. I've had my doubts about[NL]
Grado ever since our war started.[A][NL]
I had hoped that an explanation would[NL]
come up, but I've heard nothing.[A][NL]
Thus, this betrayal... It seems[NL]
to be the best course of action.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm sorry to put you in this position.[NL][A]
It couldn't have been easy for[NL]
you or the other soldiers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, I should thank you.[A][NL]
I've been questioning Grado's[NL]
actions for a while now.[A][NL]
At last, I can see a very[NL]
real alternative.[A][NL]
Would you mind if I joined[NL]
the Frelian forces, stranger?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I... are you sure about this?[A][NL]
You'd be expected to fight against[NL]
your own countrymen.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then I will hope we can convince them.[NL][A]
If not, then I have nothing more[NL]
to say to them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well...[NL]
We'll be glad to have you with us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I am Lukas, a now former knight[NL]
of Grado. You are?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Prince Roy of Frelia.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Pleasure to meet you, prince.[A]
