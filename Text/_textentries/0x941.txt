Hmm...[NL]
What would I do...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadPortrait][0x04][0x01]
Milord? You're still up?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I just needed a bit of time[NL]
to think about things.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Is something bothering you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's just an odd thought.[NL]
Pay me no mind.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I see... I don't usually[NL]
spend that much time thinking.[A][NL]
But perhaps I could help out?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
This might be a good question[NL]
for you, actually.[A][NL]
If Frelia were to fall to evil like[NL]
Grado has, would you still be loyal?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Uhh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don't believe it's going to happen[NL]
but I also wouldn't know what to do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Right. I've never thought about that[NL]
because I've never doubted you.[A][NL]
I swore my loyalty to you[NL]
because I believed in you.[A][NL]
That's all there is to it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You're right. I'm dwelling on[NL]
dark thoughts too much.[A] Good night.[A]
