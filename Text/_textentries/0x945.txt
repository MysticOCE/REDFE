Roy? It's good to see you[NL]
but why are you here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I... I was worried about you.[NL][A]
Cain had said you were ambushed[NL]
by soldiers from Grado.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah, that. It was troubling, but[NL]
we survived. Is Cain with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, he survived. Er...[A]

I suppose we should catch up later.[NL]
We'll talk again after this battle.[NL][A]

If you've come this far, your[NL]
training in Renais must've gone well.[NL][A]
Shall we return to battle?[A]
