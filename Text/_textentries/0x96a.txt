I might. But how can I trust you?[A][NL]
Forgive me, but you seem less[NL]
than trustworthy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Can't blame you for that.[A][NL]
I came here because I have this odd[NL]
feeling our employer won't pay up.[A][NL]
I did a bit of digging and the man's[NL]
not that wealthy.[A][NL]
Even so, he's hired a huge amount of[NL]
mercenaries and it doesn't add up.[A][NL]
[OpenLeft]
You suspect he won't pay you then?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Aye. The mercenary guild won't be happy[NL]
but they're not that powerful.[A][NL]
I'm looking for stabler work and so[NL]
are the rest of the boys.[A]
[OpenLeft]
I see...[NL][Yes]
