Found you, Prince Roy...[A]
[MoveMidLeft]
[CloseEyes]Urgh...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Cain! Please stay still for a[NL]
moment, those wounds need treatment![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[OpenEyes]
No time for that, sire.[A][NL]
Prince Eliwood has been attacked[NL]
by Grado's forces![A]
[OpenMidRight]
What? Is my father...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
He was fine but we need to move fast.[A][NL]
I wish I could move faster but[NL]
I encountered some soldiers[NL]
along the way...[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
Where is he?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
In the south of Renais.[A][NL]
I was going to get some more men[NL]
and return to his side but..[A]
[OpenMidRight]
First King Fado, now this...[CloseEyes][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenEyes]
Cain, I will go to my father's side.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Sire? It's not my place to argue[NL]
but this will be dangerous.[A][NL]
Grado's forces are strong[NL]
and it's not safe for you there.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You might be right about that, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
This time, I refuse to stand idly while[NL]
others are in danger.[A]
[MoveRight]
I will not run.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Heh...[A] I understand that feeling as well.[A][NL]
Very well, Prince. I'll ride with you.[A][NL]
[OpenRight]
Thank you, Cain. [A]
Now, we move![A]
