Phew...[A][NL]
We've put some distance between us[NL]
and that monster...[A][NL]
[OpenRight]
Monster?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
There's no way I could match[NL]
that rider...[A][2NL]
We're lucky he spared us[NL]
but that doesn't reassure me.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
There was nothing we could've[NL]
done for King Fado.[A]

...How did you know what I[NL]
was thinking of?[A]

[CloseEyes]
Logically, there wasn't anything[NL]

It frustrates me. For all my[NL]
efforts, I'm useless when needed.[A][NL]
