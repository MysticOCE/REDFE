Maria! Oh, Maria... you're not[NL]
hurt, are you?[A]
[OpenRight][MoveLeft]
Not at all! Well...[A][NL]
Some ruffians tried to lay [NL]

I see. Maria, why don't you tell me all[NL]
about that later? [ToggleSmile]Is Michalis here?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
He is, but he's recovering from his[NL]
injuries. Sir Klimt can tell you more.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That's a relief. Thank you for[NL]
saving Maria.[A][NL]
If you are ever in need, know that [NL]
House Medon always repays its debts.[A]
