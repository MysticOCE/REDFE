Phew...[A]
[OpenRight]
L-Lord Tirado? Is something wrong?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Very wrong! Prepare reinforcements.[A][NL]
I had thought the Prince to be caught[NL]
but I severely underestimated him.[A]
[OpenRight]
Er... Where are the soldiers[NL]
you took with you to capture him?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Slain in battle. Only the elite among[NL]
them are left and they'll be here soon.[A]
[OpenRight]
The entire troop? But how could that be?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Cease your stalling, call in the others![A][NL]
We can still capture him but we'll need[NL]
every man and trick available to us.[A]
[OpenRight]
And what are we doing about the[NL]
Frelian's currently attacking the fort?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
As long as Commander Bernard is there[NL]
we should be able to buy enough time.[A][NL]
We only need to stall them until we can[NL]
defeat the elder prince.[A][NL]
I must have my revenge for this...[NL]
disgraceful defeat.[A]

As you command.[A][NL]
