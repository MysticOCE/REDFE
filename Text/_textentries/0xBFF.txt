Hmm?[A][NL]
[MoveLeft]
Roy, is that you?[A]
[OpenRight]
I've returned, grandfather.[A]
[OpenLeft]
[ToggleSmile]
I'm glad to see you safe.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]
When I heard about the attack[NL]
on Renais, I worried for you.[A][2NL]
I sent some people to look for you.[NL]
Are they with you?[A]
[OpenRight]
Yes, Alan and I did recieve[NL]
some assistance from them.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x05][0x01]
We're here, your Majesty.[A]
[OpenLeft]
You've done well.[NL]
Rest for now.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]
Grandfather, about Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft]
Yes...[A][NL]
I've heard of what happened.[A][2NL]
From the information I've[NL]
recieved, Fado is dead[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft]
He made his decision. I don't[NL]
agree with it, but he did what he did.[A]
[OpenRight]
Yes[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
I know there was nothing I[NL]
could've done there.[A]
[OpenLeft]
There is little I could've done either.[A][2NL]
Grado's military eclipses the combined[NL]
might of Renais and Frelia's.[A][2NL]
I will mourn Fado later, but for[NL]
now, we have business to take care of.[A]
[OpenRight]
How can I help?[A]
[OpenLeft]
[ToggleSmile]
I'm glad to see you're eager to help.[A][NL]
But I'll handle these matters.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]
You should rest for now.[A]
[OpenRight]
Grandfather... is there[NL]
anything I could do to help?[A][NL]
If matters are as serious as you say[NL]
I could deal with some other issues.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
There were some brigands[NL]
gathering at the borders.[A]
[OpenRight]
I can handle that.[NL]
Is there anything else?[A]
[OpenLeft]
Eliwood is already in the area[NL]
so you may see him there.[A][NL]
I'll send some aid with you to[NL]
Salem. [.][A]

Priscilla.[.][A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x07][0x01]
Yes, your Majesty?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Roy, these two will be accompanying[NL]
you during this mission.[A]
[OpenLeft]
A pleasure to meet you.[A]
[OpenRight]
It's an honor, milord.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
If that's all for now, I must take[NL]
care of some arrangements.[A][2NL]
[ToggleSmile]
Good luck, Roy.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenFarRight]
We'll prepare to leave.[A][NL]
[ClearFace]
[OpenRight]
Seems we'll be working[NL]
together for a while...[A]
