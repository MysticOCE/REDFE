You there! Are you the commander?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That I am. You've broken[NL]
through most impressively.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I must ask you this.[A][NL]
Why has Grado invaded?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[CloseEyes]
I couldn't tell you why.[NL]
Was that all?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...? You're very...[NL]
helpful for an enemy general.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[OpenEyes]
And what exactly were you[NL]
expecting of me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Bandits ravage this country[NL]
but Grado has had made no move to[NL]
secure any of Renais.[A][NL]
I can't understand why Grado would[NL]
go to war at all. It all seems like[NL]
senseless destruction.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I certainly can't [NL]
disagree with that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What kind of knight would[NL]
support such a barbaric move?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[HalfCloseEyes]
Well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Is this the true nature of Grado?[A][NL]
Is the country you pledged to[NL]
fight for with your life?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...No. [....]No, this is not[NL]
what Grado once was.[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]
The fort is yours.[NL]
Excuse me.[A]
[ClearPortrait]
[OpenMidRight]
Wait![A]
[MoveRight]
Hmm... Father always said[NL]
compassion was the highest virtue.[A][NL]
I just hope I haven't made[NL]
a mistake here.[A]
