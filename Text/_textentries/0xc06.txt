We've found bandits[NL]
in Renais so soon?[A][2NL]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x07][0x01]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x08][0x01]
I'm not surprised.[A][NL]
As soon as Renais fell, the[NL]
people had no one left to rely on.[A][2NL]
Were I a bandit, I would[NL]
take this chance and relish it.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I suppose I never thought[NL]
of it that way, but you're right.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
This is an interesting view of[NL]
things, but perhaps we should move?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Right. We'll deal with these[NL]
brigands and continue our mission.[A]
