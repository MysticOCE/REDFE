What[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] What were those things?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I hadn't seen those last time I[NL]
fought these rabble.[A][NL]
I don't know anything more than[NL]
you, Prince. My apologies.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Milord, whatever they send at us[NL]
you need not worry.[A][NL]
Whether they send skeletons, axe horses[NL]
or other things, we'll be there for you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[OpenFarLeft]
Still, we'd best be prepared for[NL]
the worst. [A]We don't know what other[NL]
fiends Grado could send at us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]I may know what these things are.[A][NL]
It was mentioned in some of the texts[NL]
we studied back in Renais.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Oh, uh... Of course. Why don't you[NL]
remind us what they were?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[HalfCloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes]Please go on, sire.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
During the days of the Demon King[NL]
demons walked the land.[A][NL]
Skeletons, snakes like humans, men[NL]
like horses... Even walking corpses.[A][NL]
But with the Demon King's defeat and the[NL]
Sacred Stones, how can they...?[A]
[OpenLeft]
Sire, it changes nothing. Were[NL]
we not rushing to your father's aid?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You're right. Even if we must face[NL]
fiends, I could not abandon my father.[A][NL]
We'll just have to be careful[NL]
moving forward from now.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenLeft]
I too, must redouble my efforts...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Indeed. You'll have much to[NL]
study once we return.[A]
