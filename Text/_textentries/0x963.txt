Ho! I wish I could have met you under[NL]
different circumstances, Prince Eliwood.[A][NL]
That is all I'll say -[NL]
now draw and face Bernard![A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
Commander Bernard, are you aware that[NL]
forces led by my son are storming[A][NL]
the castle as we speak?[A][NL]
Will you not stand down?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I will willing die for my cause! You[NL]
will too, if you have earned your name.[A][NL]
You, of all people, know that is[NL]
what chivalry means.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I will die for a just cause, yes.[NL]
I would not die for yours, Commander.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Are you aware of what destruction[NL]
Grado has wrought in Renais?[A][NL]
Have you seen the bandits reign free?[NL]
The fiends fighting alongside Grado?[A][NL]
Your needless war has brought nothing[NL]
suffering to Renais.[A][NL]
Will you fight for that cause?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
As we were fighting off bandits from[NL]
Renais's villages, Tirado ambushed us.[A][NL]
A whole battalion dedicated to slaying[NL]
two of my squires and I.[A][NL]
Ask Miledy, who now fights with me.[NL]
Will you turn a blind eye to all this?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][....]
Is this the truth? Is this all[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
You know it to be true, don't you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
But[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[ToggleMouthMove] why? Why is all of[NL]
this happening?[A][NL]
[MoveMidLeft]
Give me answers![A]
[OpenMidRight]
I do not know. Only one man does[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Come, fight alongside me so that we[NL]
may reach that truth together.[A][NL]
No matter how terrible it may be.[A]
