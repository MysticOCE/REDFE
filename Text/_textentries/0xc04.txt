Milord, milord! Your majesty, I-[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Come in, please. Your panic does not[NL]
befit your station as messenger.[A][NL]
I trust there is reason for it?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
The Tower of Valni, your Majesty![NL]
It was attacked, and so swiftly-[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Valni was attacked?[NL]
Is the Sacred Stone safe!?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
N-no, milord. [NL]
The Sacred Stone was shattered.[A][NL]
Selena Fluorspar led Grado's forces.[NL]
Skeletons and corpses among them, too![A][NL]
The guards at Valni resisted, but[NL]
to a man they are dead.[A][NL]
The enemy has retreated to Renais.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I see. Thank you.[NL]
Is there any more ill news?[A][NL]
Perhaps the Sacred Twins are[NL]
lost as well?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
No, milord. That is the only[NL]
silver lining I bear.[A][NL]
The Sacred Twins were untouched.[A][NL]
They have been relocated to[NL]
Castle Frelia.[A][NL]
That- that is all the sorrow I[NL]
have to convey.[A]
