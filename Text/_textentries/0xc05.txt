Father. Don't blame yourself.[NL]
You can't blame yourself.[A][NL]
None of us could have[NL]
foreseen this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That does not lessen my grief.[NL]
What will every citizen of Frelia say?[A][NL]
[CloseEyes]
"Lo, under the reign of our sage king[NL]
has the Sacred Stone been lost."[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
And more than ever now we[NL]
need your guidance. [A][NL]
Magvel needs it, our people need[NL]
it... and I need it.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Grandfather, is there any tactical[NL]
advantage they could gain form this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No, Roy. I cannot see it. This was an[NL]
attack on nothing but the Sacred Stone.[A][NL]
There could be no conceivable purpose[NL]
other than its destruction.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Then most likely, Grado's only military[NL]
objectives are the Sacred Stones.[A][NL]
Renais was invaded and used as[NL]
a base for their Frelian foray.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What you say rings terrible but true.[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]
Vigarde has debased an entire nation[NL]
commit this deviltry.[A][NL]
What is he thinking? No doubt Grado's[NL]
stone has been obliterated as well.[A]
[OpenLeft]
If this is right, I don't think we're[NL]
in danger from Grado any more.[A][NL]
They have no more reason to[NL]
harm our people.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Insightful as you have been, Roy,[NL]
I cannot take any further risks.[A][NL]
The people will in a state of terror[NL]
so I must take action to secure Frelia.[A][NL]
The Knights of Frelia have to be[NL]
mobilised, as do our reserves.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I would like to mount an attack[NL]
on the capital itself, Father.[A][NL]
We must decapitate the gorgon, so[NL]
to speak- and posthaste.[A][NL]
And yet, we may be too late in warning[NL]
Rausten and Jehanna.[A][NL]
Without warning, they too may[NL]
lose their Sacred Stones.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
And this is where Roy comes in.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[MoveFarLeft]
What-? You're sending Roy-[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Hear me out, Eliwood.[NL]
He will be in no danger.[A]
