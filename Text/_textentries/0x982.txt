...and I believe that's all we[NL]
know as of yet...[A]

My father's upcoming battle[NL]
with Grado may yet reveal the truth.[A][NL]
I had only meant to spend a brief[NL]
time in Carcino before going to Jehanna.[A][NL]
If I could ask for your assistance[NL]
in reaching Jehanna...[A]
[OpenRight]
You have our full support as promised.[NL]

Fine, I'll go.[A][NL]
Don't forget your part of the deal.[A][NL]

[OpenMidLeft]
Of course. In times like these, we[NL]
all need to come together.[A][X]
