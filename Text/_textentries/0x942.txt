Prince Roy, please hold for a moment.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, Sir Lukas?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I was supposed to meet up with an[NL]
agent from Lord Tirado here.[A][NL]
They may not know that I have[NL]
changed sides yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What are you planning then?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Perhaps I can convince them[NL]
to share their information.[A][NL]
Or if that doesn't work, perhaps[NL]
we could capture them instead.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
If you're comfortable doing that[NL]
then I have no objections.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
There's no need to be concerned.[NL]
I had some questions to ask as well.[A]
