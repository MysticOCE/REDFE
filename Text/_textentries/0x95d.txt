Lord Eliwood, we must make haste![NL]
Prince Roy has already arrived- [A][NL]
we must wipe out these rats of Grado[NL]
before misfortune befalls him![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Kieran[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[ToggleMouthMove] I appreciate your ardour, but[NL]
remember that there are human lives[A][NL]
lives to be taken today. And besides[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadPortrait][0x18][0x01]
[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[ToggleMouthMove]No, I understand, Lord Eliwood.[A][NL]
My people have indeed committed heinious[NL]
sins.[A][CloseEyes] Sins that I, a knight of Grado[NL]
cannot forgive, much less Frelia.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Melady, you say that, yet you[NL]
cannot meet my eyes.[A][NL]
Will you be able to turn your lance[NL]
on your own countrymen?[A][NL]
If you cannot, you need not[NL]
fight with us today.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[OpenEyes]
No, Lord Eliwood! I may be a traitor[NL]
but I am a traitorous knight.[A][NL]
I still need a worthy cause to[NL]
call my own.[A] And your cause[NL]
Lord Eliwood, is just.[A][NL]
It is a cause that I am willing[NL]
to cut down my people for.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Melady[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[ToggleMouthMove] I am glad to have you[NL]
as a comrade in arms.[.][ToggleSmile] Thank you.[A][NL]
Kieran, who is the enemy[NL]
general we face?[A]
[OpenLeft]
I... don't remember. The villagers said[NL]
something about Tyrant? Tyre-rad?[A][NL]
Aargh![MoveLeft] I'm no good with names![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Tirado. A rising star in Grado's army,[NL]
subordinate to that scum Valter,[A][NL]
and just as sly and treacherous[NL]
as his master.[A] Lord Eliwood[NL]
we must stay cautious.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, indeed. Now then, enough talk.[NL]
Let's show them our might![A]
