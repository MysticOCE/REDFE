Excuse me, er, milady. [NL]
Are you alright?[A]
[OpenRight]
Oh, sir knight! [A][NL]
As thanks for rescuing me, I hereby[NL]
proffer you my hand to kiss.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
E-Excuse me?[A]
[OpenRight]
[ToggleSmile]
Well? Will the no-name but dashing[NL]
knight keep his lady waiting?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Er, I'm not actually a knight.[NL]
I'm Roy of Frelia-[A]
[OpenRight]
You mean THE Prince Roy?[NL]
Son of Prince Eliwood?[A][NL]
Then I was right about my savior [NL]
being a handsome young prince![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
(This girl is quite... strange.)[A][NL]
Dare I ask why you were being[NL]
chased those thugs?[A]
[OpenRight]
[ToggleSmile]
Oh, about that...[NL]
It's a bit of a story.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
In summary, you're a young[NL]
noblewoman of Rausten.[A][NL]
You ran away from home with your[NL]
retainers to find your missing brother.[A][NL]
You think your elder sister is[NL]
searching for you and someone else[A][NL]
has placed a bounty your head.[A][NL]
That explains the thugs, then.[A][NL]
And now, you're headed off to Carcino[NL]
to meet a family friend. Is that right?[A]
[OpenRight]
Will you aid me on my quest, Sir Roy?[NL]
My path is simply strewn with terrors-[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
Which is why I will aid you home.[NL]
Both your siblings must be worried sick.[A][NL]
You can accompany us safely to Rausten.[A]
[OpenRight]
Then I beg your leave! I've come[NL]
this far without help.[A][NL]
I shall go to Carcino with your aid[NL]
or without it![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
[MoveMidLeft]
Wait, milady! I-[A]
[OpenRight][LoadPortrait][0x22][0x01]
Yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I-I've... I've changed my mind.[NL]
Fine, you win. I'll take you to Carcino.[A]
[OpenRight]
...[ToggleSmile]Despite your reluctance to kiss[NL]
ladies' hands, you're a model knight![A][NL]
My house will eternally be in your debt.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
[CloseEyes]
But... But I'm not a knight...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadPortrait][0x04][0x01]
You know, Master Roy, she's right.[NL]
Don't sweat the details![A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]
You haven't been knighted, but you're[NL]
a knight in all but name already.[A]
