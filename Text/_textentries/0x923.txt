Not a problem![A][NL]

Um, things seem like they're getting[NL]
pretty rough around here.[A][NL]
Mind if I tag along a bit? I was[NL]
looking for my teacher who went missing.[A][NL]
I haven't found him yet, but I[NL]
know he's out there![A][NL]
I'm not giving up but I don't really[NL]
want to go at it alone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's fine. We were about to go south.[A][NL]
If you think he's down there[NL]
you're welcome to join us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Alright! [A]
I'm Ewan, a student[NL]
of magic. Who are you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm Roy, son of Prince Eliwood.[NL]
We'll be heading out again soon.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
Huh? He's a prince?[NL]
Didn't expect that...[A][NL]

This sounds like it could be fun...[A]
