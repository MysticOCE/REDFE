It can't be...[A]
[MoveMidLeft]
Lukas, why in the blazes[NL]
are you fighting for Frelia?[A][NL]
Have you reneged on your[NL]
knightly vows?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Sir Bernard... I didn't want to[NL]
face you, but perhaps this is fate.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lukas, have you gone mad?[NL]
Why would you betray your country?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I am a traitor to Grado[NL]
but my conscious is clear.[A][NL]
This land we occupied...[A][NL]
We watched it burn and blinded[NL]
ourselves as they begged for help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
But Serafew was safe...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That was something we decided on our own.[NL]
We took the initiative to secure Serafew.[A][NL]
[HalfCloseEyes]
Other places were not so[....]... fortunate.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[OpenEyes]
Grado has changed. It's not...[A][NL]
The soldiers work with bandits[NL]
and apparently, monsters too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Monsters? I'd written that off as[NL]
nonsense but if you say so...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You've seen them for yourself?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'd recieved a report about the dead[NL]
rising and attacking people.[A][NL]
At the time, I'd brushed it off[NL]
but this can't be a coincidence[....]...[A][NL]
[CloseEyes]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Haha... We truely live in unusual times.[NL]
I vowed to protect innocents back then.[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]
And to carry out that oath, I shall now[NL]
betray my homeland.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Sir Bernard?
[OpenMidLeft]
I think I'll be joining you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Truely?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. Until peace returns, my axe[NL]
shall follow Frelia![A]
