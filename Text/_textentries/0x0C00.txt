Hmm?[A][NL]
[MoveLeft]
Roy, is that you?[A]
[OpenRight]
I've returned, grandfather.[A]
[OpenLeft]
[ToggleSmile]
I'm glad to see you safe.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]
When I heard about the attack[NL]
on Renais, I worried for you.[A][2NL]
I sent some people to look for[NL]
you, did you meet them along the way?[A]
[OpenRight]
Yes, Alan and I did recieve[NL]
some assistance from them.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x05][0x01]
We're here, your Majesty.[A]
[OpenLeft]
You've done well.[NL]
Rest for now.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]
Grandfather, about Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft]
Yes...[A][NL]
I've heard of what happened.[A][2NL]
From the information I've[NL]
recieved, Fado is dead[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenLeft]
He made his decision. I don't[NL]
agree with it, but he did what he did.[A]
[OpenRight]
Yes[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
I know there was nothing I[NL]
could've done there.[A]
[OpenLeft]
There is little I could've done either.[A][2NL]
Grado's military eclipses the combined[NL]
might of Renais and Frelia's.[A][2NL]
I will mourn Fado later, but for[NL]
now, we have business to take care of.[A]
[OpenRight]
How can I help?[A]
[OpenLeft]
[ToggleSmile]
I'm glad to see you're eager to help.[A][2NL]
[ToggleSmile]
With the fall of Renais, I've[NL]
heard some concerning rumors.[A][2NL]
I'd like for you to go investigate[NL]
the current state of Renais.[A]
[OpenRight]
I can do that. Was there[NL]
something you were worried about?[A]
[OpenLeft]
I hear law and order has broken down in Renais.[A][NL]
While I doubt bandits would be any threat to[NL]
us, the people of Renais would need help.[A]
[OpenRight]
So you want me to head in and[NL]
deal with the bandits?[A]
[OpenLeft]
Eliwood is already in the area[NL]
so I'd like for you to assist him.[A][2NL]
[ToggleSmile]
I'm sure Eliwood would be glad[NL]
to see you safe.[A]
[ToggleSmile]
Salem. [.][A]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x02][0x01]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x08][0x01]
I'm here.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Priscilla.[.][A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x07][0x01]
Yes, your Majesty?[A]
[OpenLeft]
Roy, these two will be accompanying[NL]
you during this mission.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
It's nice to meet[NL]
you, Salem, Priscilla.[A]
[OpenRight]
It's an honor, milord.[A]
[OpenLeft]
If that's all for now, I must take[NL]
care of some arrangements.[A][2NL]
[ToggleSmile]
Good luck, Roy.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenFarRight]
We'll prepare to leave.[NL]
[ClearFace]
[OpenRight]
Seems we'll be working for a while...[A]
