Oh, wow. You've come pretty far, huh?[A]

[OpenMidRight]
As you might've noticed, things are[NL]
a little messy at the moment.[A][NL]
It'll be some more time before the[NL]
v2.0 release and we've got a lot to do.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
But we appreciate you playing this.[A][NL]
If you had any feedback, come say[NL]
hello on our discord.[A][NL]
The[Beat] last few chapters[NL]
are new to a lot of people.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
It's pretty obvious. v2.0 was meant to[NL]
be out by the end of April but[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Things happen but the project[NL]
is still alive.[A][NL]
Just a quick note - don't save over[NL]
this file just yet.[A][NL]
The transition from this to the next[NL]
part of the game isn't done yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You'd best save this file and play[NL]
on a different file.[A][NL]
You might have to redo the chapter[NL]
but that's less than[A][NL]
having to replay the game.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Anyway, that's all we had to say.[NL]
See you again soon![A]
