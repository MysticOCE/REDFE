Phew[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][....]
Thank you for the help, Prince.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Have we met before?[A]
[OpenRight]
No, but I do handle certain[NL]
things for Frelia.[A][2NL]
[ToggleSmile]
I've seen you around the[NL]
castle a few times.[A]
[ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]
That does explain things, yes.[NL]
[A]
[OpenRight]
I was pretty worried for a bit.[A][NL]
I'd just finished looking into[NL]
some of the bandit gangs around here.[A][2NL]
Seems the problem is a lot[NL]
worse than it should be.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Odd.[.] Grandfather sent me out here[NL]
to check on the recent affairs.[A][2NL]
[OpenRight]
Hmm?[.] His Majesty sent you to[NL]
fight off bandits?[A][NL]
If that's the case, then I'll[NL]
join with your party.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That would be appreciated.[NL]
You mentioned some bandit gangs?[A]
[OpenRight]
Yes, they've taken over an old fort[NL]
to the south.[A] I'll tell you about[NL]
them on the way.[A][X]
