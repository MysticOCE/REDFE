I don't believe it's too much farther[NL]
to Jehanna, Prince Roy.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's good to hear. The recent[NL]
monster attacks have me worried.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh? Jehanna is by no means weak.[A][NL]
And the forces of Grado would[NL]
also face difficulty with monsters[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm not so sure about that[Beat][A][NL]
Father Saias, have you ever heard of[NL]
fiends and humans working together?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
The Demon King was purported to[NL]
rule both human and inhuman followers.[A][NL]
Fiends and humanity are opposed[NL]
to each other by instinct.[A][NL]
It would take a great amount of power[NL]
to force them to cooperate.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
I-[....]I see[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight]
A combined front would be indeed[NL]
something to worry about.[A][NL]
Jehanna would not survive that.[A][NL]
Were the worst come to happen, even[NL]
Rausten would be forced to move.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then haste is of utmost importance.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
[OpenFarRight][LoadAlan]
Enemy forces ahead![NL]
They've got control of the pass![A]
[OpenRight]
Oh dear.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Of all the times[Beat][A][NL]
[MoveLeft]
All forces, prepare for combat![A]
