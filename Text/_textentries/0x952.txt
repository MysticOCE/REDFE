Father![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Roy? It's good to see you[....]...[NL]
but what are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[ToggleMouthMove] I was worried about you.[NL][A]
Cain had said you were ambushed[NL]
by soldiers from Grado.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah, that. It was troubling, but[NL]
we survived. Is Cain with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[ToggleMouthMove]father-
[OpenMidRight]
Ah[....]...[NL]
You don't need to say it.[A][NL]
He fell valiantly, yes? That is[....]...[NL]
[CloseEyes]
what a knight strives for.[A][NL]
To serve the motherland with[NL]
each dying breath[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]
[MoveMidLeft]
But father, he needn't have-!

[OpenEyes]
Roy! You are the prince of Frelia-[NL]
the commander of these forces![A][NL]
Roy[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[ToggleMouthMove] you cannot run away from loss.[NL]
You cannot blame yourself.[A][NL]
Instead, cherish what Sir Cain died[NL]
fighting for - the hope of peace.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I understand, father.
[OpenMidRight]
Roy, I know my words cannot reach your[NL]
ears just yet. [A]I swear that one day,[NL]
however, you will understand.
