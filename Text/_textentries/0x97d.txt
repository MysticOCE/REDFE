Master Klimt, first of all[Beat][A][NL]
My brother... can you tell me[NL]
where Michalis is?[A][NL]
I've been looking for him[NL]
for weeks now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[Event]
Michalis, hm? I think it'd be best[NL]
if I showed you instead. Go on.[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveFarFarRight]
Michalis! Brother![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadPortrait][0x54][0x01]
He's asleep, Lady Maria. Let him rest.[A][NL]
Two weeks ago, he limped here with[NL]
wounds so grave, my physician[A][NL]
proclaimed his survival a miracle.[A][NL]
I've been nursing him ever since, but he[NL]
stirs for mere minutes a day, if that.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
Who did this to him, Master Klimt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Michalis has many enemies, sir.[A][NL]
And this place grows more treacherous[NL]
by the day.[A][NL]
Pablo of the Council of Carcino has[NL]
discovered his presence here.[A][NL]
I do believe he will soon attempt[NL]
to claim the bounty on his head -[A][NL]
and perhaps settle his score with me[NL]
as well. He needs to be -[A]

Master Roy![MoveFarLeft] Master Roy![A]
[OpenRight]
Alan! What is the meaning-[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
A band of armed men are headed towards[NL]
this town, swords drawn![A][NL]
The town guard have been alerted, but[NL]
they'll be overwhelmed. Sir?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Looks like Pablo made his move[NL]
earlier than I thought.[A][NL]
Prince Roy?[.] You need to get Michalis[NL]
and Maria far from this place.[A][NL]
I can lie to them and[NL]
buy you some time.[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft]
Master Klimt! Don't say you'll[NL]
sacrifice yourself like this![A]
[OpenFarRight]
Oh, I've lived long enough, Lady Maria.[NL]
Your lives are more valuable than mine.[A][NL]
Please don't argue about it. Move![.][A]
[OpenLeft]
No! That's not happening![NL]
Sir Roy, please[Beat] tell him.[A]
[OpenRight]
Alan, how many men are there?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I'm not exactly sure but[Beat][NL]
I'd guess a whole lot?[A][NL]
Maybe twice as many as we have?[A]
[OpenRight]
All right, Alan. [NL]
Give the order to move out.[A][NL]
We're taking charge of this[NL]
town's defence![A]
[OpenFarRight]
Prince, you're not serious?[A]
[OpenRight]
I am. They may have numbers, but[NL]
they're just mercenaries. [A][NL]
They can't be well-supplied, so if[NL]
can just hold out long enough, we win.[A][NL]
They'll be be forced to retreat.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I was hoping you'd say that, milord![NL]
I'll relay the orders.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenRight]
Not to worry, Master Klimt.[NL]
There are ballistae nearby too.[A][NL]
If we control them, that's half[NL]
the battle won.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Prince Roy, are you sure of this?[NL]
This will be bloody.[A][NL]
You have another choice.[.][A]
[OpenRight]
Giving you up is not a choice.[A]
[OpenLeft][MoveLeft]
Spoken so heroically, Sir Roy![A]
[OpenFarRight]
Heroically indeed[Beat] very well,[NL]
Prince Roy. I am in your hands.[A]
