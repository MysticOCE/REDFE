Er... chief? Looks like the folks[NL]
we were meant to be working with...[A]
[OpenRight]
Yep. They got taken out quick. Wouldn't[NL]
want to fight the other side.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]
Hmm... Yeah, I think we can still[NL]
get something out of this.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPortrait][0x02][0x01]
[MoveMidLeft]
More enemies?[A]
[OpenRight]
Peace. Is Lady Maria with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
She is. Did you have business with her?[A]
[OpenRight]
We'd heard she was in trouble, so we[NL]
set out to ride to her aide.[A][NL]
I've had good dealings with her brother[NL]
in the past and I couldn't stand[A][NL]
idly while his sister was in danger.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's... quite the story.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadPortrait][0x22][0x01]
Oh, did someone mention my name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lady Maria, do you know these men?[NL]
They claim to know your brother.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Hmm... Even if they did know my brother[NL]
I probably wouldn't know them.[A][NL]
I never see him spend time with friends[NL]
or ever having fun, really.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]
Honestly, I didn't know he had friends![A]
[OpenRight]
It's... more so business associates.[A][NL]
We're mercenaries, not merchants.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, we can discuss payment later[NL]
but we'd be interested in hiring you.[A][NL]
Lady Maria, we need to discuss[NL]
some things.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Of course. Good-bye![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Farewell.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight]
Well, I'm impressed. Didn't know[NL]
you were such a smooth talker, chief.[A][NL]
Didn't know you were friends with[NL]
that girl's brother though.[A]
[OpenRight]
[ToggleSmile]
Well, I have worked for him.[NL]
Can't say I know him well.[A][NL]
But don't mention that.[A][NL]
Come on, let's meet the others.[A]
