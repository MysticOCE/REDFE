Here we are. My sources tell me[NL]
that Bazba's bandits reside here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Bazba's bandits?[A]
[OpenRight]
The leader of the biggest bandit[NL]
group in the area.[A] 
[ClearFace]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x0E][0x01]
I did a bit of snooping, but[NL]
people are scared of him.[A][NL]
All I know is that he's a fierce[NL]
fighter and an absolute brute.[A][2NL]
My apologies.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's quite alright.[A][NL]
If he's the leader of this crew[NL]
taking him out would be a necessity.[A][NL]
[OpenRight]
Best keep an eye out, milord.[A][NL]
There's plenty of bandits and[NL]
they can't all be in here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I understand. We'll drive[NL]
these bandits out then![A]
