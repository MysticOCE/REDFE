[CloseEyes]
Urgh... Grado will never forgive[NL]
you for this, you traitor...[A]
[OpenLeft]
I've said what I had to.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
We need information.[A][NL]
If you're willing to talk, we might[NL]
be able to afford you some leeway.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...Damn. As long as no one from[NL]
Tirado's group is around.[A][NL]
They are... unkind to traitors.[A]
[OpenLeft]
And will they forgive you for this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
They don't need to know this then.[NL]
We can keep this quiet, yes.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Perhaps. Where is Prince Eliwood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
We're unsure of that as well. [A][NL]
Last we heard of him, Lord Tirado[NL]
was chasing him down in Renais.[A][NL]
He'd managed to ambush the prince[NL]
but he couldn't finish him off.[A][NL]
Beyond that, I can't say.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[CloseEyes]
Father...
[OpenLeft]
I'll take him away then.[A]

[OpenFarLeft]
...If I can save my father, will I be[NL]
able to face King Fado in the afterlife?[A][NL]
[....]
[OpenEyes]
Enough contemplation. I need to do this.[A]
