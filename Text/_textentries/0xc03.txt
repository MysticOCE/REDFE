Eliwood, Roy. It does me good to[NL]
see you both unharmed.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Thank you, father. You probably hadn't[NL]
imagined we'd stumble into such a mess.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Imagine my dismay when I learnt[NL]
you'd been ambushed![A][NL]
I was preparing to lead the knights of[NL]
Frelia in search of the missing princes.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
My apologies... I'm sorry to[NL]
have worried you, father.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
And Roy... I'm sorry. I never wanted[NL]
you to get involved in this mess.[A][NL]
You're too young to have dealings[NL]
with this war.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Then sending me to fend off bandits...[....][NL]
that was a distraction, wasn't it?[A][NL]
To prevent my getting embroiled with[NL]
the war effort.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Don't look that way, Roy.[NL]
Father meant well.[A][NL]
You should have been studying in[NL]
Renais right now, not taking[A][NL]
on Grado's best men.[A]
[OpenLeft]
But I'm a prince of Frelia,[NL]
just as you are![A][NL]
Protecting our kingdom is my[NL]
responsibility, and...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
And you've done that admirably.[A][NL]
But you're not ready to be on the[NL]
frontlines just yet.[A][NL]
Do you understand that?[A]
[OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
That doesn't mean you'll be sitting[NL]
idle while Eliwood engages Grado.[A][NL]
I have a special task in mind for you.[A]
[OpenLeft]
A special task?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That's better. I'll tell you, but[NL]
I need to know the full story first.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
And who better to tell it than[NL]
Grado's own soldiers?[A][NL]
Lukas, Bernard-[A]
