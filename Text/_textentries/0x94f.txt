It can't be[....]...[A]
[MoveMidLeft]
Lukas, why in the blazes[NL]
are you fighting for Frelia?[A][NL]
Have you reneged on your[NL]
knightly vows?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Sir Bernard[....]... I didn't want to[NL]
face you, but perhaps this is fate.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lukas, have you gone mad?[NL]
Why would you betray your country?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I am a traitor to Grado[NL]
but my conscious is clear.[A][NL]
We occupied Renais.[.] We looted.[.][A][NL]
We broke.[.] We burnt.[.] We killed.[.][NL]
I cannot stand this, Commander![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
But Serafew was safe...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That was something you and I ensured.[NL]
We took the initiative to secure Serafew.[A][NL]
[HalfCloseEyes]
Other places were not so[....]... fortunate.[A]

[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]

[OpenEyes]
Grado has changed. It's not...[A][NL]
The soldiers work with bandits[NL]
and apparently, monsters too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Monsters? I'd written that off as[NL]
nonsense but if you say so...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You've heard about them, then?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'd recieved a report about the dead[NL]
rising and attacking people.[A][NL]
At the time, I'd brushed it off[NL]
but this can't be a coincidence[....]...[A][NL]
[CloseEyes]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Haha... We truly live in unusual times.[NL]
I vowed to protect innocents back then.[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]
And to carry out that oath, I shall now[NL]
betray my homeland.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Sir Bernard?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I think I'll be joining you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Truly?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. Until peace returns, my axe[NL]
shall follow Frelia![A]
