General Bernard. I didn't want to[NL]
meet you like this...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Miledy, why? His death...[NL]
shouldn't have happened.[A][NL]
And you shouldn't have been expelled[NL]
from the Royal Guard.[A][NL]
But will you break your oaths over[NL]
your misfortunes?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I already have. I no longer believe[NL]
in what I once swore.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[CloseEyes]
"To protect and preserve Grado - to[NL]
guide it to a new prosperity..."[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[CloseEyes]
"...I will take its[NL]
enemies' life willingly.[A][NL]
More willingly will I give my own."[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]
I still remember how proud I was to[NL]
say those words all those years ago.[A][NL]
But no longer. I now see my countries[NL]
actions for they truly are.[A][NL]
And they fill me with deep shame.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[OpenEyes]
Miledy, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][A][CloseEyes]
[OpenMidRight]
But you do no see yet, do you? Then[NL]
metal will speak. Come, Commander![A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[ToggleMouthMove]I will join you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You will[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[ToggleMouthMove] join us?[NL]
You will turn traitor?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[OpenEyes]
I have broken my own oaths in my heart.[A][NL]
I, too, no longer fully[NL]
believe in my own cause.[A][NL]
I will come with you and see the truth[NL]
as you have seen it with your eyes.[A]
