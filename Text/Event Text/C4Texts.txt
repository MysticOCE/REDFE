Something's not right here.[NL]
It's too quiet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah! Over there![A]

Got him. We've got the little[NL]
prince surrounded.[A]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x6A][0x01]
Boss? Are you sure we[NL]
need... those?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleSmile]
Do you think I'm a fan[NL]
of these freaks either?[A][NL]
But if they want to die instead of[NL]
us, I'll accept their help.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Right, right. It's just...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Alright, what's the problem?[NL]
Spit it out.[A]
[OpenLeft]
You sure they're not[NL]
going to eat us?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[HalfCloseEyes]
...If you're worried about that, just[NL]
stick with me and I'll keep an eye out.[A][NL]
Get back to waiting for the enemy.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Right, boss...[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
[CloseEyes]
Urgh, I should be paid to[NL]
stand the stench...[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]
I wonder how the brass[NL]
managed to get these...[A][NL]
Bah, I don't want to know.[A]

Oh... Has help finally come?[A][NL]
We've been cutting wood in this[NL]

I never expected to see a day where[NL]
the life of the village was in danger.[A][NL]
We'll be closing the gates.[NL]
Best of luck fighting off these beasts.[A][NL]
And here, take this. It might help.[A]

What[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] What were those things?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I hadn't seen those last time I[NL]
fought these rabble.[A][NL]
I don't know anything more than[NL]
you, Prince. My apologies.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Milord, whatever they send at us[NL]
you need not worry.[A][NL]
Whether they send skeletons, axe horses[NL]
or other things, we'll be there for you.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[OpenFarLeft]
Still, we'd best be prepared for[NL]
the worst. [A]We don't know what other[NL]
fiends Grado could send at us.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]I may know what these things are.[A][NL]
It was mentioned in some of the texts[NL]
we studied back in Renais.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Oh, uh... Of course. Why don't you[NL]
remind us what they were?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[HalfCloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes]Please go on, sire.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
During the days of the Demon King[NL]
demons walked the land.[A][NL]
Skeletons, snakes like humans, men[NL]
like horses... Even walking corpses.[A][NL]
But with the Demon King's defeat and the[NL]
Sacred Stones, how can they...?[A]
[OpenLeft]
Sire, it changes nothing. Were[NL]
we not rushing to your father's aid?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You're right. Even if we must face[NL]
fiends, I could not abandon my father.[A][NL]
We'll just have to be careful[NL]
moving forward from now.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenLeft]
I too, must redouble my efforts...[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Indeed. You'll have much to[NL]
study once we return.[A]

I'm not particularly keen on being[NL]
around these freaks, but someone had[A][NL]
to protect this village.[A][NL]
Your lot's taking out these monsters?[A][NL]

I'll join up with you then. That's a[NL]
group I can work with.[A]
