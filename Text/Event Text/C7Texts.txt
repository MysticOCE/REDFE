It can't be...[A]
[MoveMidLeft]
Lukas, why in the blazes[NL]
are you fighting for Frelia?[A][NL]
Have you reneged on your[NL]
knightly vows?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Sir Bernard... I didn't want to[NL]
face you, but perhaps this is fate.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lukas, have you gone mad?[NL]
Why would you betray your country?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I am a traitor to Grado[NL]
but my conscious is clear.[A][NL]
This land we occupied...[A][NL]
We watched it burn and blinded[NL]
ourselves as they begged for help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
But Serafew was safe...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That was something we decided on our own.[NL]
We took the initiative to secure Serafew.[A][NL]
[HalfCloseEyes]
Other places were not so[....]... fortunate.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[OpenEyes]
Grado has changed. It's not...[A][NL]
The soldiers work with bandits[NL]
and apparently, monsters too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Monsters? I'd written that off as[NL]
nonsense but if you say so...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You've seen them for yourself?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'd recieved a report about the dead[NL]
rising and attacking people.[A][NL]
At the time, I'd brushed it off[NL]
but this can't be a coincidence[....]...[A][NL]
[CloseEyes]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Haha... We truely live in unusual times.[NL]
I vowed to protect innocents back then.[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]
And to carry out that oath, I shall now[NL]
betray my homeland.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Sir Bernard?
[OpenMidLeft]
I think I'll be joining you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Truely?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. Until peace returns, my axe[NL]
shall follow Frelia![A]

Father![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Roy? It's good to see you[NL]
but why are you here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I... I was worried about you.[NL][A]
Cain had said you were ambushed[NL]
by soldiers from Grado.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah, that. It was troubling, but[NL]
we survived. Is Cain with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, he survived. Er...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I suppose we should catch up later.[NL]
We'll talk again after this battle.[NL][A]
[ToggleSmile]
If you've come this far, your[NL]
training in Renais must've gone well.[NL][A]
Shall we return to battle?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes![A]

Fort Renvall...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadPortrait][0x04][0x01]
It's the largest fort int he are, sire.[NL]
If your father was captured[NL]
he'll likely be here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
If he is here, then we must aid him.[NL][A]
Still, now that I'm here, something[NL]
seems odd to me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
There's no need to worry, sire.[NL]
I'll lead the charge![A]
