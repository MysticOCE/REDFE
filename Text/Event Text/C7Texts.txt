[MoveMidLeft]
Lukas, why in the blazes[NL]
are you fighting for Frelia?[A][NL]
Have you reneged on your[NL]
knightly vows?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Sir Bernard[....]... I didn't want to[NL]
face you, but perhaps this is fate.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lukas, have you gone mad?[NL]
Why would you betray your country?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I am a traitor to Grado[NL]
but my conscious is clear.[A][NL]
This land we occupied[....]...[A][NL]
We watched it burn and blinded[NL]
ourselves as they begged for help.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
But Serafew was safe...?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That was something we decided on our own.[NL]
We took the initiative to secure Serafew.[A][NL]
[HalfCloseEyes]
Other places were not so[....]... fortunate.[A]

[OpenEyes]
Grado has changed. It's not...[A][NL]
The soldiers work with bandits[NL]
and apparently, monsters too.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Monsters? I'd written that off as[NL]
nonsense but if you say so...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You've heard about them, then??[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'd recieved a report about the dead[NL]
rising and attacking people.[A][NL]
At the time, I'd brushed it off[NL]
but this can't be a coincidence[....]...[A][NL]
[CloseEyes]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
Haha... We truely live in unusual times.[NL]
I vowed to protect innocents back then.[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]
And to carry out that oath, I shall now[NL]
betray my homeland.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Sir Bernard?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I think I'll be joining you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Truly?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. Until peace returns, my axe[NL]
shall follow Frelia![A]

Roy? It's good to see you[....]...[NL]
but what are you doing here?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[ToggleMouthMove] I was worried about you.[NL][A]
Cain had said you were ambushed[NL]
by soldiers from Grado.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah, that. It was troubling, but[NL]
we survived. Is Cain with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, he is. Er...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Roy, we'll catch up later.[NL]
Let's talk again after this battle.[NL][A]

If you've come this far, your[NL]
training in Renais must've gone well.[NL][A]

Roy! You are the prince of Frelia-[NL]

Roy[ToggleMouthMove][....]...[ToggleMouthMove] you cannot run away from loss.[NL]
You cannot blame yourself.[A][NL]
Instead, cherish what Sir Cain died[NL]
fighting for - the hope of peace.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I understand, father.
[OpenMidRight]
Roy, I know my words cannot reach your[NL]
ears just yet. [A]I swear that one day,[NL]

It's the largest fort in the area, sire.[NL][A]
If your father was captured[NL]
he'll likely be here.[A]

If he is here, then we must aid him.[A][NL]
Still, now that I'm here, something[NL]
seems odd to me.[A]
