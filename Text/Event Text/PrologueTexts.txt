The continent of Magvel.[A][NL]
For some 800 years, a quiet peace reigned in [.][NL]
the absence of the terrible darkness.[.][A][NL]
The Sacred Stones have been passed from [NL]
generation to generation.[.][A][NL]
Nations have been built around their power [.][NL]
and their legacy.[.][A][0x02][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The kingdom of Renais, ruled by Fado, [NL]
the peerless Warrior King.[A][0x02][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The kingdom of Frelia, ruled by Elbert, [NL]
the venerable Knight King.[A][0x02][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The kingdom of Jehanna, ruled by Ismaire, [NL]
Queen of the White Dunes.[.][A][0x02][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The theocracy of Rausten, ruled by Alvis, [.][NL]
the Divine Emperor.[.][A][0x02][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Grado Empire, ruled by Vigarde, [NL]
the stalwart Silent Emperor.[A][0x02][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]These five countries house the power of [NL]
the Sacred Stones.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They are joined by the emerging mercantile [.][NL]
republic of Carcino.[A][0x02][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]In these times of peace, tales of past[NL]
conflict have drifted into legend,[A][NL]
and memories of the ancient dark arts[.][NL]
have all but evaporated.[A][0x02][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]It is now the year 803...[.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]In an instant, the whole of Magvel is [NL]
threatened by an unexpected atrocity.[.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Grado Empire, the largest of the [.][NL]
Sacred Stone nations,[.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]has invaded the kingdom of Renais under [NL]
orders from Emperor Vigarde.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A longtime ally of Grado, Renais is caught[NL]
off guard, unable to mount any resistance.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Grado's forces move quickly, seizing one[NL]
territory after another.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Grado's momentum carries its armies to the [.][NL]
gates of Castle Renais itself.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Renais will fall...[.][NL]
It is inevitable.[.][A][NL]
