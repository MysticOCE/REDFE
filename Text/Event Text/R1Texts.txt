Oh, if only there were a brave[NL]
hero to save me from these ruffians![A]
[OpenLeft][LoadPortrait][0x02][0x01]
Well, I'm not exactly a brave hero[NL]
but I won't stand idle.[A][NL]
Get behind me, we'll talk later![A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleSmile]
(My, he's cute!)[A][NL]
[.]Oh, thank you! While I was fleeing, I[NL]
lost track of my retainers.[A][NL]
If you see them, just tell me[NL]
and I'll tell them to help out![A]

Maria! Where are you![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Calm down. Maria's sharper than her[NL]
pursuers, she's still alive.[A][NL]
Can you get higher and take a[NL]
look for her?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ClearFace]
[....]
[OpenRight][LoadPortrait][0x22][0x01]
She's to the north with some[NL]
people I can't recognise.[A][NL]
They seem to be protecting her from[NL]
the mercenaries. We must help them![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
My thoughts as well. Come on,[NL]
let's get moving.[A]

Samson![A]
[OpenLeft]
Maria! Good to see you're alright.[A]
[OpenRight]
Yes, I was rescued by that man with[NL]
the red hair and the hairband.[A]
[OpenLeft]
I can see him. How about we help[NL]
with this fight and thank him later?[A]
[OpenRight]
[ToggleSmile]
Just what I was thinking![A][NL]
Let's show these ruffians just who[NL]
they picked a fight with![A]

Lady Maria![A]
[MoveMidRight]
I was so worried about you![NL]
Are you alright?[A]
[OpenRight]
I'm okay, I'm okay! You don't[NL]
need to worry about me so much![A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidLeft]
I'm really glad to hear that.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]
When I lost you, I was worried you'd[NL]
been kidnapped or worse![A]
[OpenRight]
I did nearly get captured... but[NL]
then I was rescued by a hero![A][NL]
[CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]
And he's cute too...[A]
[OpenLeft]
[ToggleSmile]
Well, I'll be sure to thank him later.[A][NL]
But for now, allow me to[NL]
take care of these foes.[A]

Well, well... Would you happen[NL]
to be the youngest prince of Frelia?[A]
[OpenLeft]
I may be. Is something the matter?[A]
[OpenRight]
Wary, prince? I can't blame you.[NL]
We are on opposing sides.[A][NL]
Still... These folk don't pay too well[NL]
and I'm not keen on hunting children.[A][NL]
My boys have to eat but we're[NL]
looking for better work.[A][NL]
Happen to know anyone who might pay[NL]
better? Say, 4,000 gold?[A]
[X]

## RoyGazelleGotMoney
[OpenLeft]
I might. But how can I trust you?[A][NL]
Forgive me, but you seem less[NL]
than trustworthy.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Can't blame you for that.[A][NL]
I came here because I have this odd[NL]
feeling our employer won't pay up.[A][NL]
I did a bit of digging and the man's[NL]
not that wealthy.[A][NL]
Even so, he's hired a huge amount of[NL]
mercenaries and it doesn't add up.[A][NL]
[OpenLeft]
You suspect he won't pay you then?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Aye. The mercenary guild won't be happy[NL]
but they're not that powerful.[A][NL]
I'm looking for stabler work and so[NL]
are the rest of the boys.[A]
[OpenLeft]
I see...[NL][Yes]

## RoyGazelleNowBrokeBoi
[OpenLeft]
I'd like to hire you and your crew.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleSmile]
Glad to hear that.[NL]
I'll collect the money after[NL]
the battle, for now, we fight![A]
[X]

## RoyGazelleBrokeBoi
[OpenLeft]
No, I'm sorry. We're running[NL]
low on funds.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah. Never mind. I'll just take the[NL]
money and bury my conscience.[A][NL]
No worries.[A]

Er... chief? Looks like the folks[NL]
we were meant to be working with...[A]
[OpenRight]
Yep. They got taken out quick. Wouldn't[NL]
want to fight the other side.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]
Hmm... Yeah, I think we can still[NL]
get something out of this.[A][NL]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadPortrait][0x02][0x01]
[MoveMidLeft]
More enemies?[A]
[OpenRight]
Peace. Is Lady Maria with you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
She is. Did you have business with her?[A]
[OpenRight]
We'd heard she was in trouble, so we[NL]
set out to ride to her aide.[A][NL]
I've had good dealings with her brother[NL]
in the past and I couldn't stand[A][NL]
idly while his sister was in danger.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's... quite the story.[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadPortrait][0x22][0x01]
Oh, did someone mention my name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Lady Maria, do you know these men?[NL]
They claim to know your brother.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Hmm... Even if they did know my brother[NL]
I probably wouldn't know them.[A][NL]
I never see him spend time with friends[NL]
or ever having fun, really.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]
Honestly, I didn't know he had friends![A]
[OpenRight]
It's... more so business associates.[A][NL]
We're mercenaries, not merchants.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, we can discuss payment later[NL]
but we'd be interested in hiring you.[A][NL]
Lady Maria, we need to discuss[NL]
some things.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Of course. Good-bye![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Farewell.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenFarRight]
Well, I'm impressed. Didn't know[NL]
you were such a smooth talker, chief.[A][NL]
Didn't know you were friends with[NL]
that girl's brother though.[A]
[OpenRight]
[ToggleSmile]
Well, I have worked for him.[NL]
Can't say I know him well.[A][NL]
But don't mention that.[A][NL]
Come on, let's meet the others.[A]
