No, I'm not familiar with them.[NL]
What do we know about them?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Of late, I have heard of individuals[NL]
who can summon monsters.[A][NL]
Traditionally, summoners can only call[NL]
on phantoms.[A][NL]
But if what I hear is true, then[NL]

[OpenMidLeft]
I see[Beat] Then we should prioritise[NL]
