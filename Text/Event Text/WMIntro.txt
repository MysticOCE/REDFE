With the aid of mercenaries hired by  [.][NL]
King Elbert, Roy makes his escape.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]While Roy had longed to return to [.][NL]
Frelia, he could not have foreseen[.][A][NL]
such a tumultous homecoming.[.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces][X]

# 0x08DE
Grado's grasp has pressed the life [.][NL]
out of Renais.[.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Brigands and bandits run amok,[.][NL]
burning, thieving, plundering, pillaging.[.][A][0x02][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]"This... this cannot stand."[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]With these words, Roy swears to [NL]
end this anarchy.[A][0x02][NL]


[LoadOverworldFaces]Roy is not the only Frelian trying to  [.][NL]
restore order, however. The Frelian [A][NL]
spy Leila has been lurking in Renais.[.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A chance meeting in Ide can  [NL]
give Roy a valuable lead...[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces][X]

# 0x08E0
Now united with Leila, Roy [NL]
plunges into enemy territory.[.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The danger here is not Grado, however, [NL]
for in these mountains reside the[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]fearsome cutthroats of Bazba's  [NL]
Bandits.[.][A][NL]
If Renais is to be preserved, Roy must [.][NL]
destroy them.[A][NL]

Crown Prince Eliwood, Knight of Frelia.[NL]
While on reconnaissance duty, he and his[.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]knights were ambushed... with many, many[.][NL]
casualties.[A][NL]
Roy is caught between fear on one[NL]
hand and faith on another. [A]"My father yet[NL]
lives... I know it. And I will save him!"[.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]But he does not know yet what monstrosities [.][NL]
await him...[.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces][X]

# 0x08E2
With every step Roy takes, he finds more [.][NL]
questions than answers. What were those [.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]foul creatures creeping through the realm? [.][NL]
Are they linked to Grado? If so, how? [.][A][NL]
"And... Father. Where is he? Is he..." [NL]
"No. He is strong; he had to be safe."[.][A][0x02][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]As he steps into the town of Serafew, [.][NL]
memories of a peaceful Magvel and [A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]a happy friendship flood back...  [NL]
Starkly contrasting with the reality[.][NL]
of a once peaceful town, now firmly[.][A][NL]
under Grado's boot. [NL]

Roy suppresses his feelings of unease [.][NL]
and continues to search for his father.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Passing through Serafew, the group crosses [.][NL]
into the Grado Empire.[A][0x02][NL]
From here forward, there is no doubt that[.][NL]
they are walking through hostile territory.[.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Following a new lead,[.][A][NL]
Roy and company head for a sparsely[NL]
populated region of Grado.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]There, they have the chance [.][NL]
to intercept Grado's intelligence.[A][NL]

# 0x08E4
So Tirado had been the author [NL]
of all this evil. Roy is determined to[.][A][NL]
bring the villain to justice. Heartened [.][NL]
by the knowledge of his father's[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]survival, he rushes to Renvall. [NL]
The fort had been considered one[.][A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]of Grado's best defended... but taken[.][NL]
aback by Roy's sudden attack, its [.][A][NL]
garrison was forced to retreat into the.[NL]
castle[.][A][NL]
Roy's perilous journey is at an end...[A][NL]
One way or another.[A][NL]
