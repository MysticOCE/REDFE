I don't believe it's too much farther[NL]
to Jehanna, Prince Roy.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's good to hear. The recent[NL]
monster attacks have me worried.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh? Jehanna is by no means weak.[A][NL]
And the forces of Grado would[NL]
also face difficulty with monsters[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm not so sure about that[Beat][A][NL]
Father Saias, have you ever heard of[NL]
fiends and humans working together?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
The Demon King was purported to[NL]
rule both human and inhuman followers.[A][NL]
Fiends and humanity are opposed[NL]
to each other by instinct.[A][NL]
It would take a great amount of power[NL]
to force them to cooperate.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
I-[....]I see[Beat][A]
[OpenMidRight]
A combined front would be indeed[NL]
something to worry about.[A][NL]
Jehanna would not survive that.[A][NL]
Were the worst come to happen, even[NL]
Rausten would be forced to move.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then haste is of utmost importance.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
[OpenFarRight][LoadAlan]
Enemy forces ahead![NL]
They've got control of the pass![A]
[OpenRight]
Oh dear.[A]

[OpenMidLeft]
Of all the times[Beat][A][NL]
[MoveLeft]
All forces, prepare for combat![A]

Hey there, pal. Heard a group helped[NL]
the folks in Carcino a while ago.[A][NL]
They say they were an odd[NL]
bunch of folks.[A][NL]
You look pretty odd to me, pal.[A][NL]
Take this. You may be strange folk[NL]
but you seem like nice folk.[A][NL]
Good luck out there.[A]

Oh, I didn't realise I left the[NL]
door open.[A][NL]
You're with the Frelian[NL]
army, aren't you?[A][NL]
We all appreciate you dealing with[NL]
Pablo. Bad for business, he was.[A][NL]
This whole war's bad for business.[NL]
This here's a token of my appreciation[NL]
for ending that little scuffle.[A][NL]
