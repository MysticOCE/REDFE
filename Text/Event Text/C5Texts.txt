Hmm... Frelia's forces have[NL]
finally come for this town.[A][NL]
Are you prepared, Lukas?[A]
[OpenRight]
Of course. The ballista are in[NL]
position. We're prepared for this.[A][2NL]
[HalfCloseEyes]
...[....][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What bothers you, soldier?[A]
[OpenRight]
Forgive me, but...[A][NL]
Grado, Frelia and Renais were allies for[NL]
such a long time.[A] I just don't[NL]
understand the reason for this war[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I wish I could tell you why.[A][NL]
But as knights of Grado, it is[NL]
our duty to follow the orders of the king.[A][NL]
We live to serve and serve we shall.[A]
[OpenRight]
Indeed... We are knights of...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I must return to Renvall.[NL]
Good luck, Lukas.[A]

You there! Are you the commander?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That I am. You've broken[NL]
through most impressively.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I must ask you this.[A][NL]
Why has Grado invaded?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[CloseEyes]
I couldn't tell you why.[NL]
Was that all?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...? You're very...[NL]
helpful for an enemy general.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[OpenEyes]
And what exactly were you[NL]
expecting of me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Bandits ravage this country[NL]
but Grado has had made no move to[NL]
secure any of Renais.[A][NL]
I can't understand why Grado would[NL]
go to war at all. It all seems like[NL]
senseless destruction.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I certainly can't [NL]
disagree with that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What kind of knight would[NL]
support such a barbaric move?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[HalfCloseEyes]
Well...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Is this the true nature of Grado?[A][NL]
Is the country you pledged to[NL]
fight for with your life?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...No. [....]No, this is not[NL]
what Grado once was.[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]
The fort is yours.[NL]
Excuse me.[A]
[ClearPortrait]
[OpenMidRight]
Wait![A]
[MoveRight]
Hmm... Father always said[NL]
compassion was the highest virtue.[A][NL]
I just hope I haven't made[NL]
a mistake here.[A]

Ah, good. Frelia's forces[NL]
have finally come for us.[A][NL]
Nothing against these Grado soldiers[NL]
but Serafew is a town of many groups.[A][NL]
It's not the sort of town that[NL]
should be occupied like this.{A][2NL]
But do go easy on the commander here.[A][NL]
Sir Lukas has been very kind and[NL]
he's made many moves to protect us.[A][NL]
He's not a bad sort at all.[A][NL]
It might be a little hopeful from me[NL]
but I do hope we can end this peacefully.[A]
Try and talk to him[NL]
for this old man's sake.[A]

Sorry about the wait.[NL]
Take this.[A][NL]
I wish I could help you more but[NL]
I got into a rough fight recently.[A][NL]
Can't fight with you, but this'll[NL]
help. Knock 'em out, you hear me?[A]

Oh, my, Frelian knights?[A][NL]
Good to see the king still[NL]
worries about us![A][NL]
Well, if you're going to fight those[NL]
soldiers, this might help.[A][NL]
It's been lying around the house[NL]
for a few years now.[A][NL]
But it should be fine![NL]
Good luck.[A]

Hmm...[....]No, more muscles would[NL]
be nice. A beard too.[A][NL]
Don't mind me, I'm just looking[NL]
for a new model.[A][NL]
Let me know if you see any big[NL]

Not bad at all...[NL]
[ToggleSmile]
Actually, I really like this![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[CloseEyes]I might regret asking this[NL]
but what just happened?[A]
[OpenRight]
Hey, no need to be so grumpy.[NL][A]
Whoa, you're tough! And these arms[NL]
sure are something.[A][NL]
You're something else, buster![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[OpenEyes]
[HalfCloseEyes]
Hmm...[A]
[OpenRight]
Hey, mind if I use this form for battle?[A][NL]
I won't pretend to be you otherwise[NL]
but these arms are like tree trunks![A][NL]
I'm fond of them already.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm just going to pretend this[NL]
never happened. Good bye.[A]

Hey, wait! Come back![A][NL]

Guess I'll just tag along[NL]

Sure beats hanging around here.[A]
