Serafew...It's been years[NL]
since I came here.[A][NL]
A long time ago, I came[NL]
here with my father.[A][NL]
My father was going to meet Emperor[NL]
Vigarde and I met Prince Lyon that day.[A][NL]
I never imagined that we would end up[NL]
going to war like this.[A][NL]
Back then, I greatly respected[NL]
Prince Lyon.[A]

Forgive me. I just...[A][NL]

We'll take this town back.[A][NL]
And one day, we'll have peace again.[A]

Hmm... Frelia's forces have[NL]
finally come for this town.[A][NL]
Are you prepared, Lukas?[A]
[OpenRight]
Of course. The ballista is in[NL]
position. We're prepared for this.[A][2NL]
[HalfCloseEyes]
...[....][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What bothers you, soldier?[A]
[OpenRight]
Forgive me, but...[A][NL]
Grado, Frelia and Renais were allies for[NL]
such a long time.[A] I just don't[NL]
understand the reason for this war[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I wish I could tell you why.[A][NL]
But as knights of Grado, it is[NL]
our duty to follow the orders of the king.[A][NL]
We live to serve and serve we shall.[A]
[OpenRight]
Indeed... We are knights of...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I must return to Renvall.[NL]
Good luck, Lukas.[A]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]You would be the commander?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That I am. You've broken through[NL]
our ranks most impressively.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Before we draw... I must ask you this.[A][NL]
Why has Grado invaded?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[CloseEyes]
I couldn't tell you why.[NL]
I live to serve my country.[A][NL]
There is nothing more to say.[A]

You[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] Your eyes[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][NL]

Bandits ravage Renais as we speak.[NL]
The people suffer under Grado's anarchy.[A][NL]
Sir knight...[A][NL]
I understand nothing! Why would Grado[NL]
go to war at all?[A] It all seems like[NL]
senseless destruction.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I certainly can't [NL]
disagree with that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
The knights of Frelia are proud[NL]
to serve their country... Are you?[A]

[....].[ToggleMouthMove]..[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Is this the true nature of Grado?[A][NL]
Is the country you pledged to[NL]
fight for with your life?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]No. [....]No, this is not[NL]
what Grado once was.[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]
The fort is yours.[NL]
Excuse me.[A]
[ClearPortrait]

Wait![A]
[MoveRight]
Hmm... Father always said[NL]

I just hope I haven't made[NL]

Ah, good. Frelia's forces[NL]
have finally come for us.[A][NL]
Nothing against these Grado soldiers[NL]
but Serafew is a town of many groups.[A][NL]
It's not the sort of town that[NL]
should be occupied like this.{A][2NL]
But do go easy on the commander here.[A][NL]
Sir Lukas has been very kind and[NL]
he's made many moves to protect us.[A][NL]
He's not a bad sort at all.[A][NL]
Might be a little hopeful from me but[NL]
I do hope we can end this peacefully.[A][NL]
Try and talk to him[NL]
for this old man's sake.[A]

Sorry about the wait.[NL]
Take this.[A][NL]
I wish I could help you more but[NL]
I got into a rough fight recently.[A][NL]
Can't fight with you, but this'll[NL]
help. Knock 'em out, you hear me?[A]

Oh, my, Frelian knights?[A][NL]
Good to see the king still[NL]
worries about us![A][NL]
Well, if you're going to fight those[NL]
soldiers, this might help.[A][NL]
It's been lying around the house[NL]
for a few years now.[A][NL]
But it should be fine![NL]
Good luck.[A]

Not bad at all...[NL]
[ToggleSmile]
Actually, I really like this![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...[CloseEyes]I might regret asking this[NL]
but what just happened?[A]
[OpenRight]
Hey, no need to be so grumpy.[NL][A]
Whoa, you're tough! And these arms[NL]
sure are something.[A][NL]
You're something else, buster![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[OpenEyes]
[HalfCloseEyes]
Hmm...[A]
[OpenRight]
Hey, mind if I use this form for battle?[A][NL]
I won't pretend to be you otherwise[NL]
but these arms are like tree trunks![A][NL]
I'm fond of them already.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm just going to pretend this[NL]
never happened. Good bye.[A]
[ClearFace]

Hey, wait! Come back![A][NL]

Guess I'll just tag along[NL]

Hello again. I've told my soldiers[NL]
to stand down for the time being.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That's very much appreciated.[NL]
So, you've had a change of heart?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Indeed. I've had my doubts about[NL]
Grado ever since our war started.[A][NL]
I had hoped that an explanation would[NL]
come up, but I've heard nothing.[A][NL]
Thus, this betrayal... It seems[NL]
to be the best course of action.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I'm sorry to put you in this position.[NL][A]
It couldn't have been easy for[NL]
you or the other soldiers.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No, I should thank you.[A][NL]
I've been questioning Grado's[NL]
actions for a while now.[A][NL]
At last, I can see a very[NL]
real alternative.[A][NL]
Would you mind if I joined[NL]
the Frelian forces, stranger?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I... are you sure about this?[A][NL]
You'd be expected to fight against[NL]
your own countrymen.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then I will hope we can convince them.[NL][A]
If not, then I have nothing more[NL]
to say to them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well...[NL]
We'll be glad to have you with us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I am Lukas, a now former knight[NL]
of Grado. You are?[A]

Prince Roy of Frelia.[A]

Hmm...[NL]
What would I do...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadPortrait][0x04][0x01]
Milord? You're still up?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I just needed a bit of time[NL]
to think about things.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Is something bothering you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's just an odd thought.[NL]
Pay me no mind.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I see... I don't usually[NL]
spend that much time thinking.[A][NL]
But perhaps I could help out?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
This might be a good question[NL]
for you, actually.[A][NL]
If Frelia were to fall to evil like[NL]
Grado has, would you still be loyal?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Uhh...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don't believe it's going to happen[NL]
but I also wouldn't know what to do.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Right. I've never thought about that[NL]
because I've never doubted you.[A][NL]
I swore my loyalty to you[NL]
because I believed in you.[A][NL]
That's all there is to it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You're right. I'm dwelling on[NL]
dark thoughts too much.[A] Good night.[A]
