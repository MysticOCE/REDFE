Here we are. My sources tell me[NL]
that Bazba's bandits reside here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Bazba's bandits?[A]
[OpenRight]
The leader of the biggest bandit[NL]
group in the area.[A] 
[ClearFace]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x0E][0x01]
I did a bit of snooping, but[NL]
people are scared of him.[A][NL]
All I know is that he's a fierce[NL]
fighter and an absolute brute.[A][2NL]
My apologies.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's quite alright.[A][NL]
If he's the leader of this crew[NL]
taking him out would be a necessity.[A][NL]
[OpenRight]
Best keep an eye out, milord.[A][NL]
There's plenty of bandits and[NL]
they can't all be in here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I understand. We'll drive[NL]
these bandits out then![A]

Hoo boy...[.][NL]
I need the money but...[A][2NL][CloseEyes]
This feels like a bad idea.[A][NL][OpenEyes]
Well, I don't get to pick[NL]
who pays me. Just gotta do this.[A]

Err... Have I seen you before?[A]
[MoveMidRight]
[OpenFarLeft]
Odd time to strike up a[NL]
conversation, isn't it?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I still feel like I've[NL]
seen that hair before...[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
...! [MoveMidRight]Prince Eliwood?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[MoveMidLeft]
You... know my father?[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
You're his son?[A][NL]
A long time ago, he came to our[NL]
village.[A] My sister was ill[NL]
and we couldn't afford her medicine.[A][NL]
But then, the prince came and[NL]
bought the medicine for us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleSmile]
That does sound like[NL]
my father, yes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
It meant the world to us.[NL][A]
We were worried she was going[NL]
to die, all because we were poor.[A][2NL]
Since then, I've been hoping[NL]
for a day where I could repay him.[A]
[MoveRight]
Please, let me join you![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I'll be glad to have you[NL]
with us, friend.[A]
[OpenRight]

Radd?[NL]
You're betraying us?[A][NL]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x09][0x01]
I may need the money.[A][2NL]
But I could never quite stomach[NL]
the idea of being a bandit.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
Bah! You're about to learn just[NL]
what kind of mistake you made, boy.[A]

Found you, Prince Roy...[A]
[MoveMidLeft]
[CloseEyes]Urgh...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Cain! Please stay still for a[NL]
moment, those wounds need treatment![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[OpenEyes]
No time for that, sire.[A][NL]
Prince Eliwood has been attacked[NL]
by Grado's forces![A]
[OpenMidRight]
What? Is my father...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
He was fine but we need to move fast.[A][NL]
I wish I could move faster but[NL]
I encountered some soldiers[NL]
along the way...[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
Where is he?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
In the south of Renais.[A][NL]
I was going to get some more men[NL]
and return to his side but..[A]
[OpenMidRight]
First King Fado, now this...[CloseEyes][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenEyes]
Cain, I will go to my father's side.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Sire? It's not my place to argue[NL]
but this will be dangerous.[A][NL]
Grado's forces are strong[NL]
and it's not safe for you there.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You might be right about that, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
This time, I refuse to stand idly while[NL]
others are in danger.[A]
[MoveRight]
I will not run.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Heh...[A] I understand that feeling as well.[A][NL]
Very well, Prince. I'll ride with you.[A][NL]
[OpenRight]
Thank you, Cain. [A]
Now, we move![A]
