[ClearFace]
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x0E][0x01]
I did a bit of snooping, but[NL]
people are scared of him.[A][NL]
All I know is that he's a fierce[NL]
fighter and an absolute brute.[A][2NL]
My apologies.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's quite alright.[A][NL]
If he's the leader of this crew[NL]
taking him out would be a necessity.[A][NL]
[OpenRight]
Best keep an eye out, milord.[A][NL]
The ruffians have numbers[NL]
and I doubt all of them[A][NL]
are currently present...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I understand. We'll drive[NL]
these bandits out then![A]

[MoveMidRight]
[OpenFarLeft]
Er... You don't look like[NL]

...! [MoveMidRight]Prince Eliwood?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[MoveMidLeft]
You... know my father?[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
You're his son, aren't you?[A][NL]
A long time ago, he came to our[NL]
aid...[A] My sister was deathly ill[NL]
and we couldn't afford her medicine.[A][NL]
It was he who came and[NL]
bought the medicine for us.[A][NL]
[CloseEyes]
I've... I've never forgotten that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleSmile]
Father...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[OpenEyes]
It meant the world to us.[NL][A]
I was so afraid...[A][NL]
I thought she would die[NL]
all because we were poor...[A][2NL]
Since then, I've been hoping[NL]
for a day where I could repay him.[A]
[MoveRight]
Please, let me join you![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I'll be glad to have you[NL]
with us. I'm Roy.[A]
[OpenRight]
The name's Radd, prince.[A][NL]

Found you, Prince Roy...[A]
[MoveMidLeft]
[CloseEyes]Urgh...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Cain! Please stay still for a[NL]
moment, those wounds need treatment![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[OpenEyes]
No time for that, sire.[A][NL]
Prince Eliwood has been attacked[NL]
by Grado's forces![A]
[OpenMidRight]
What? Is my father...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
He was fine but we need to move fast.[A][NL]
I wish I could move faster but[NL]
I encountered some soldiers[NL]
along the way...[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
Where is he?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
In the south of Renais.[A][NL]
I was going to get some more men[NL]
and return to his side but..[A]
[OpenMidRight]
First King Fado, now this...[CloseEyes][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]
[OpenEyes]
Cain, I will go to my father's side.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Sire? It's not my place to argue[NL]
but this will be dangerous.[A][NL]
Grado's forces are strong[NL]
and it's not safe for you there.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You might be right about that, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
This time, I refuse to stand idly while[NL]
others are in danger.[A]
[MoveRight]
I will not run.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Heh...[A] I understand that feeling as well.[A][NL]
Very well, Prince. I'll ride with you.[A][NL]
[OpenRight]
Thank you, Cain. [A]
Now, we move![A]
