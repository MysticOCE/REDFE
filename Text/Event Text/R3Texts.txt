Hey, princey. Perk up those ears.[NL]
You hear what I hear?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Wha-? Oh yeah. Heh.[A][NL]
You know this means. Care to make[NL]
a wager on who guts the most monsters?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Sod off, Joshua...[NL]
Fine luck we're having.[A][NL]
This is what...[NL]
the fifth mob in five days?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Fifth? I remember the eyeballs, the[NL]
cyclops and yesterday we had-[A]
[OpenRight]
Gentlemen, enough chatter. Do you[NL]
hear the sound of combat?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Sounds like a big enough group. Do you[NL]
want to leave the monsters to them?[A]
[OpenRight]
No, Joshua. It matters not who they are.[A][NL]
We are all travellers walking the[NL]
same glorious path.[A][NL]
We must offer our aid, regardless[NL]
of circumstance.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Sure, sure, Reverend Father.[NL]
Right thing to do and all, huh?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Ugh, we're renegotiating my contract[NL]
once this is done. Got that?[A]

Norris? Wow, I haven't seen you[NL]
in forever![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Kye? How have things been?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[MoveMidLeft]
Ok! Well, until we had to leave[NL]
the village.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What happened there and[NL]
where are the others?[A][NL]
I don't see Sir Saleh or too many[NL]
of the other older mages here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Umm... Saleh went missing and[NL]
the others got lost when we ran.[A][NL]

But they'll be fine! They're strong![A]

You should catch up with the others.[NL]

Haha... Prince Roy requires my skills.[NL]
How could I let him down?[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]
I wasn't expecting to come back here[NL]
but I'll be heading back out again.[A][NL]
Keep an eye on things for me, alright?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh... Okay.[NL]
Um, here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Huh? What is it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You can have this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
A talisman? I appreciate it but why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
'Cause I know you stink with magic![A][NL]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
Wha-?[NL]
