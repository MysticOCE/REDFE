Strange to be back so soon...[A][NL]
I never thought it'd be like this.[A][NL]

[MoveMidLeft]
[OpenEyes]
Whoa![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadJoshua]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadCarlyle]
Prince Joshua...?[A][NL]
[MoveMidLeft]
Can it really be you[Beat]?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh, cripes[Beat][A][NL]
Would you mind just not mentioning this?[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
If you wish, prince.[NL]
Err[Beat] Did you come to see your mother?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Came on business. Don't mind me, I'll[NL]
be getting back to my job.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hold on a moment, Joshua![A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadJoshua]
Make it quick, teach.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I intended to give you this[NL]
gift earlier, but you disappeared.[A][NL]
It's simply a gift for my student.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
A magic sword? This can't have[NL]
easy to get...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
C-Come now, my student. Am I[NL]
not a generous teacher?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[CloseEyes]
[Beat]Hoo boy. No, I'm not putting[NL]
a good word in for you with mother.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft]

Oh, wow. You've come pretty far, huh?[A]
[ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]
As you might've noticed, things are[NL]
a little messy at the moment.[A][NL]
It'll be some more time before the[NL]
v2.0 release and we've got a lot to do.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
But we appreciate you playing this.[A][NL]
If you had any feedback, come say[NL]
hello on our discord.[A][NL]
The[Beat] last few chapters[NL]
are new to a lot of people.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
It's pretty obvious. v2.0 was meant to[NL]
be out by the end of April but[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Things happen but the project[NL]
is still alive.[A][NL]
Just a quick note - don't save over[NL]
this file just yet.[A][NL]
The transition from this to the next[NL]
part of the game isn't done yet.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You'd best save this file and play[NL]
on a different file.[A][NL]
You might have to redo the chapter[NL]
but that's less than[A][NL]
having to replay the game.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Anyway, that's all we had to say.[NL]
See you again soon![A]
