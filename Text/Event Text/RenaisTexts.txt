Hmm?[A][NL]
[MoveLeft]
Roy, is that you?[A]
[OpenRight]
I've returned, grandfather.[A]
[OpenLeft]
[ToggleSmile]
I'm glad to see you safe.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]
When I heard about the attack[NL]
on Renais, I worried for you.[A][2NL]
I sent some people to look for you.[NL]
Are they with you?[A]
[OpenRight]
Yes, Alan and I did recieve[NL]
some assistance from them.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x05][0x01]
We're here, your Majesty.[A]
[OpenLeft]
You've done well.[NL]
Rest for now.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]
Grandfather, about Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft]
Indeed...[A][NL]
I've heard of what happened.[A][2NL]
From the information I've[NL]
recieved, Fado is dead[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft]
He made his decision. I don't[NL]
agree with it, but he did what he did.[A]
[OpenRight]
Yes[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
I know there was nothing I[NL]
could've done there.[A]
[OpenLeft]
There is little I could've done either.[A][2NL]
Grado's military eclipses the combined[NL]
might of Renais and Frelia's.[A][2NL]
I will mourn Fado later, but for[NL]
now, we have business to take care of.[A]
[OpenRight]
How can I help?[A]
[OpenLeft]
[ToggleSmile]
I'm glad to see you're eager to help.[A][NL]
But I'll handle these matters.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]
You should rest for now.[A]
[OpenRight]
Grandfather... is there[NL]
anything I could do to help?[A][NL]
If matters are as serious as you say[NL]
I could deal with some other issues.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
There were some brigands[NL]
gathering at the borders.[A]
[OpenRight]
I can handle that.[NL]
Is there anything else?[A]
[OpenLeft]
Eliwood is already in the area[NL]
so you may see him there.[A][NL]
I'll send some aid with you to help.[NL]
Salem. [.][A]

I'm here.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Priscilla.[.][A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x07][0x01]
Yes, your Majesty?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Roy, these two will be accompanying[NL]
you during this mission.[A]
[OpenLeft]
A pleasure to meet you.[A]
[OpenRight]
It's an honor, milord.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
If that's all for now, I must take[NL]
care of some arrangements.[A][2NL]
[ToggleSmile]
Good luck, Roy.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenFarRight]
We'll prepare to leave.[A][NL]
[ClearFace]
[OpenRight]
Seems we'll be working[NL]
together for a while...[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Is something happening, sire?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'll be heading out again.[A][NL]
Grandfather wants me to deal[NL]
with some brigands.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I'll go with you then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmm?[A][2NL]
Are you sure you're free[NL]
to do that?[A] I'd appreciate[NL]
the help but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I checked in, but things[NL]
seem rather disorganised right now.[A][2NL]
[ToggleSmile]
Besides, what kind of knight would I[NL]
be if I left my liege to fend for himself?[A][NL]
If I end up in trouble later[NL]
I'll deal with it then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleSmile]
Alan... thank you.[NL]
I can always rely on you.[A]

Eliwood, Roy. It does me good to[NL]
see you both unharmed.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Thank you, father. You probably hadn't[NL]
imagined we'd stumble into such a mess.[A]
[LoadMidRight]
Imagine my dismay when I learnt[NL]
you'd been ambushed![A][NL]
I was preparing to lead the knights of[NL]
Frelia in search of the missing princes.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
My apologies... I'm sorry to[NL]
have worried you, father.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
And Roy... I'm sorry. I never wanted[NL]
you to get involved in this mess.[A][NL]
You're too young to have dealings[NL]
with this war.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Then sending me to fend off bandits...[....]
that was a distraction, wasn't it?[A][NL]
To prevent my getting embroiled with[NL]
the war effort.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Don't look that way, Roy.[NL]
Father meant well.[A][NL]
You should have been studying in[NL]
Renais right now, not taking[A][NL]
on Grado's best men.[A]
[OpenLeft]
But I'm a prince of Frelia[NL]
just as you are![A][NL]
Protecting our kingdom is my[NL]
responsibility, and...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
And you've done that admirably.[A][NL]
But you're not ready to be on the[NL]
frontlines just yet.[A][NL]
Do you understand that?[A]
[OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidRight]
That doesn't mean you'll be sitting[NL]
idle while Eliwood engages Grado.[A][NL]
I have a special task in mind for you.[A]
[OpenLeft]
A special task?
[OpenMidRight]
That's better. I'll tell you, but[NL]
I need to know the full story first.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
And who better to tell it than[NL]
Grado's own soldiers?[A][NL]
Lukas, Bernard.[....] Could you[NL]
please step in?[A]
