Hmm?[A][NL]
[MoveLeft]
Roy, is that you?[A]
[OpenRight]
I've returned, grandfather.[A]
[OpenLeft]
[ToggleSmile]
I'm glad to see you safe.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]
When I heard about the attack[NL]
on Renais, I worried for you.[A][2NL]
I sent some people to look for you.[NL]
Are they with you?[A]
[OpenRight]
Yes, Alan and I did recieve[NL]
some assistance from them.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x05][0x01]
We're here, your Majesty.[A]
[OpenLeft]
You've done well.[NL]
Rest for now.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]
Grandfather, about Renais[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft]
Indeed...[A][NL]
I've heard of what happened.[A][2NL]
From the information I've[NL]
recieved, Fado is dead[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenLeft]
He made his decision. I don't[NL]
agree with it, but he did what he did.[A]
[OpenRight]
Yes[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
I know there was nothing I[NL]
could've done there.[A]
[OpenLeft]
There is little I could've done either.[A][2NL]
Grado's military eclipses the combined[NL]
might of Renais and Frelia's.[A][2NL]
I will mourn Fado later, but for[NL]
now, we have business to take care of.[A]
[OpenRight]
How can I help?[A]
[OpenLeft]
[ToggleSmile]
I'm glad to see you're eager to help.[A][NL]
But I'll handle these matters.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]
You should rest for now.[A]
[OpenRight]
Grandfather... is there[NL]
anything I could do to help?[A][NL]
If matters are as serious as you say[NL]
I could deal with some other issues.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
There were some brigands[NL]
gathering at the borders.[A]
[OpenRight]
I can handle that.[NL]
Is there anything else?[A]
[OpenLeft]
Eliwood is already in the area[NL]
so you may see him there.[A][NL]
I'll send some aid with you to help.[NL]
Salem. [.][A]

Priscilla.[.][A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x07][0x01]
Yes, your Majesty?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Roy, these two will be accompanying[NL]
you during this mission.[A]
[OpenLeft]
A pleasure to meet you.[A]
[OpenRight]
It's an honor, milord.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
If that's all for now, I must take[NL]
care of some arrangements.[A][2NL]
[ToggleSmile]
Good luck, Roy.[A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft]
[OpenFarRight]
We'll prepare to leave.[A][NL]
[ClearFace]
[OpenRight]
Seems we'll be working[NL]
together for a while...[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Is something happening, sire?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'll be heading out again.[A][NL]
Grandfather wants me to deal[NL]
with some brigands.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I'll go with you then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmm?[A][2NL]
Are you sure you're free[NL]
to do that?[A] I'd appreciate[NL]
the help but...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I checked in, but things[NL]
seem rather disorganised right now.[A][2NL]
[ToggleSmile]
Besides, what kind of knight would I[NL]
be if I left my liege to fend for himself?[A][NL]
If I end up in trouble later[NL]
I'll deal with it then.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleSmile]
Alan... thank you.[NL]
I can always rely on you.[A]

Roy and Eliwood will soon[NL]
be parting ways.[A][NL]
Roy's events will occur first[NL]
then Eliwood's events shall occur.[A]

Eliwood, Roy. It does me good to[NL]
see you both unharmed.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Thank you, father. You probably hadn't[NL]
imagined we'd stumble into such a mess.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Imagine my dismay when I learnt[NL]
you'd been ambushed![A][NL]
I was preparing to lead the knights of[NL]
Frelia in search of the missing princes.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
My apologies... I'm sorry to[NL]
have worried you, father.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
And Roy... I'm sorry. I never wanted[NL]
you to get involved in this mess.[A][NL]
You're too young to have dealings[NL]
with this war.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Then sending me to fend off bandits...[....][NL]
that was a distraction, wasn't it?[A][NL]
To prevent my getting embroiled with[NL]
the war effort.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Don't look that way, Roy.[NL]
Father meant well.[A][NL]
You should have been studying in[NL]
Renais right now, not taking[A][NL]
on Grado's best men.[A]
[OpenLeft]
But I'm a prince of Frelia,[NL]
just as you are![A][NL]
Protecting our kingdom is my[NL]
responsibility, and...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
And you've done that admirably.[A][NL]
But you're not ready to be on the[NL]
frontlines just yet.[A][NL]
Do you understand that?[A]
[OpenLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
That doesn't mean you'll be sitting[NL]
idle while Eliwood engages Grado.[A][NL]
I have a special task in mind for you.[A]
[OpenLeft]
A special task?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That's better. I'll tell you, but[NL]
I need to know the full story first.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
And who better to tell it than[NL]
Grado's own soldiers?[A][NL]
Lukas, Bernard-[A]

Milord, milord! Your majesty, I-[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Come in, please. Your panic does not[NL]
befit your station as messenger.[A][NL]
I trust there is reason for it?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
The Tower of Valni, your Majesty![NL]
It was attacked, and so swiftly-[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Valni was attacked?[NL]
Is the Sacred Stone safe!?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
N-no, milord. [NL]
The Sacred Stone was shattered.[A][NL]
Selena Fluorspar led Grado's forces.[NL]
Skeletons and corpses among them, too![A][NL]
The guards at Valni resisted, but[NL]
to a man they are dead.[A][NL]
The enemy has retreated to Renais.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...I see. Thank you.[NL]
Is there any more ill news?[A][NL]
Perhaps the Sacred Twins are[NL]
lost as well?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
No, milord. That is the only[NL]
silver lining I bear.[A][NL]
The Sacred Twins were untouched.[A][NL]
They have been relocated to[NL]
Castle Frelia.[A][NL]
That- that is all the sorrow I[NL]
have to convey.[A]

Father. Don't blame yourself.[NL]
You can't blame yourself.[A][NL]
None of us could have[NL]
foreseen this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That does not lessen my grief.[NL]
What will every citizen of Frelia say?[A][NL]
[CloseEyes]
"Lo, under the reign of our sage king[NL]
has the Sacred Stone been lost."[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
And more than ever now we[NL]
need your guidance. [A][NL]
Magvel needs it, our people need[NL]
it... and I need it.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Grandfather, is there any tactical[NL]
advantage they could gain form this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No, Roy. I cannot see it. This was an[NL]
attack on nothing but the Sacred Stone.[A][NL]
There could be no conceivable purpose[NL]
other than its destruction.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Then most likely, Grado's only military[NL]
objectives are the Sacred Stones.[A][NL]
Renais was invaded and used as[NL]
a base for their Frelian foray.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What you say rings terrible but true.[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]
Vigarde has debased an entire nation[NL]
commit this deviltry.[A][NL]
What is he thinking? No doubt Grado's[NL]
stone has been obliterated as well.[A]
[OpenLeft]
If this is right, I don't think we're[NL]
in danger from Grado any more.[A][NL]
They have no more reason to[NL]
harm our people.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Insightful as you have been, Roy,[NL]
I cannot take any further risks.[A][NL]
The people will in a state of terror[NL]
so I must take action to secure Frelia.[A][NL]
The Knights of Frelia have to be[NL]
mobilised, as do our reserves.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I would like to mount an attack[NL]
on the capital itself, Father.[A][NL]
We must decapitate the gorgon, so[NL]
to speak- and posthaste.[A][NL]
And yet, we may be too late in warning[NL]
Rausten and Jehanna.[A][NL]
Without warning, they too may[NL]
lose their Sacred Stones.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
And this is where Roy comes in.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[MoveFarLeft]
What-? You're sending Roy-[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Hear me out, Eliwood.[NL]
He will be in no danger.[A]

It's settled then. [A][NL]
Eliwood, you will take a handful of[NL]
men and make your way into Grado.[A][NL]
Roy, do you understand your mission?[A][NL]
It has become even more important now.[NL]
Magvel itself counts on your success.[A]
[OpenLeft]
I do grasp its gravity, Grandfather.[NL]
I'll prepare for Jehanna right away.[A][NL]
I won't let you down![A]
[OpenMidRight]
What- ha ha ha! You've only[NL]
just returned, Roy.[A][NL]
You'll burn yourself out if you romp[NL]
from country to country like that.[A][NL]
Your task is indeed of immense import,[NL]
but you need to rest.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I'll need a few knights to[NL]
defend the convoy, Father.[A][NL]
But beyond that, I require no[NL]
further Frelian troops.[A][NL]
Kieran, Miledy and Sir Bernard will[NL]
suffice to execute this surgical strike.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Milady and Bernard are from[NL]
Grado, aren't they?[A][NL]
Do you think they'll be able to-[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I've tried to dissuade Miledy but[NL]
she wouldn't have any of it.[A][NL]
And I had a talk with Sir Bernard prior.[A][NL]
"If you intend to invade Grado, you[NL]
count on my axe!", that's what he said.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I see. Then it's decided.[A]
