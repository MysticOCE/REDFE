Well, I should hand this report[NL]
in, soon. Got everything here.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPortrait][0x11][0x01]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
Cripes! Where did you come from?[NL]
I'm out of here![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmm... I shouldn't let him[NL]
flee with that report.[A]

Prince Roy, please hold for a moment.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, Sir Lukas?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I was supposed to meet up with an[NL]
agent from Lord Tirado here.[A][NL]
They may not know that I have[NL]
changed sides yet.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What are you planning then?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Perhaps I can convince them[NL]
to share their information.[A][NL]
Or if that doesn't work, perhaps[NL]
we could capture them instead.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
If you're comfortable doing that[NL]
then I have no objections.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
There's no need to be concerned.[NL]
I had some questions to ask as well.[A]
[X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadPortrait][0x3E][0x01]
That soldier better pop up soon.[NL]
Don't want to deal with more bandits.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPortrait][0x11][0x01]
My apologies for the lateness.[NL]
Were you waiting long?[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
Not particularly. How are affairs?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Serafew is holding up fine. I cannot[NL]
say the same for the rest of the area.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Hmm? That's not too surprising.[A][NL]
Lord Tirado is funding the[NL]
bandits after all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[HalfCloseEyes]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes]Excuse me?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
War isn't cheap. We need to resupply.[NL]
And Renais can't exactly fight back now.[A][NL]
He'd be a fool to turn down this chance.[NL]
An unexpected show of wisdom, really.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]support this barbarity?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Something wrong? We're all[NL]
men of Grado here, yes?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
If Grado would support such terrible[NL]
deeds, I have no regrets about this.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Huh?[A]
[X]

## C6OpeningText3
[OpenMidRight][LoadPortrait][0x3E][0x01]
Gyaargh! [MoveMidRight]
I don't know what's gotten[NL]
into him, but I'm out of here![A]
[X]

## C6RavenEnters
[OpenMidRight][LoadPortrait][0x1B][0x01]
Hmph...[....] Here too?[NL]
There's no end to these rats.[A][NL]
I'd better get started then.[A]

Prince Roy? You're out[NL]
here as well?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Did my grandfather send[NL]
you out here?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No. I was in the area[NL]
when the war struck.[A][NL]
I've been dealing with brigands[NL]
and enemy soldiers alike since.[A][NL]
They've been working together.[A][NL]
It's the only reason the bandits[NL]
have accomplished anything.[A][NL]
Their leaders are weak[NL]
and their followers worse.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You've done a good job.[NL]
Would you mind joining us?[A][NL]
We've been searching[NL]
for my father.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Fine. I can join up.[NL]
I'm Raymond.[A]
[X]
