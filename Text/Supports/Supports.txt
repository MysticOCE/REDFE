Whew[Beat] Things sure have[NL]
gotten difficult, right?[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yeah[Beat][A][NL]
I never thought we'd be putting[NL]
our training to the test so soon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Right? I thought this was a little[NL]
strange myself.[A][NL]
Why were we training if we were at[NL]
peace? I mean, I enjoy training but[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleSmile]
You enjoy swordsmanship. I've seen[NL]
you slack off in etiquette classes.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
L-Lord Roy![MoveMidRight] How did you know that?[NL]
Sir Seth never spoke of that to anyone![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh, I thought it fairly obvious.[A][NL]
Sir Seth always had the most exhausted[NL]
expression after your classes with him.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Your Highness[Beat] May I ask you[NL]
don't mention that to the other knights?[A][NL]
I really don't want remedial classes[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Relax. I wouldn't. [A][2NL]
[ToggleSmile]
These days, we have no time for classes.[NL]
Those days are long gone.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Your Highness[Beat][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
The battle still awaits us, Alan.[NL]
We'll survive this together.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[MoveMidRight]
That's right, Prince Roy.[NL]
Allow me to be your sword and shield.[A]

Hey, you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Me? Something you want, Norris?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You're an untrained mercenary, aren't[NL]
you? You're pretty calm.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, I'm not actually a mercenary.[NL]
I was just a villager before all this.[A][NL]
My old man taught me a bit[NL]
of swordsmanship though.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Hmph[Beat] Pretty confident for[NL]
a nobody then.[A][2NL]
Aren't you afraid of dying?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Not[Beat] really? I believe in[NL]
Prince Roy. He'll lead us right.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You're on the frontlines. A single[NL]
mistake will end your life.[A][NL]
How on earth are you calm about it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Umm[Beat] I'll just follow my instincts?[NL]
I'm pretty fast so I can just dodge.[A][NL]
Fighting's not really that hard.[NL]
I'll cover you, so don't worry.[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]
That's-[....] Bah! Forget it![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][MoveMidRight]
Norris? Something wrong?[A][NL]
[Beat]Man, I've got no clue[NL]
what's bugging him.[A]
